next time keep working on the add event system, need to work on calculating socres.

types will need to be updated as you changed the dateabase

show the score of the user as they input their data real time.

finally add page to show all of your events

then create league tabel. Could use static props to calculate the table and have it refresh only every 10 minuets or so?

make it so that only fda green team members can join the site.
